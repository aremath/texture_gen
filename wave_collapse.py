# Each "pixel" is in a superposition of possible pixel values
# In this case, the possible values are indexes into the physical tile table
# as well as the tile palette table.
#
# We first break the input up into n x n tiles, then match the tiles with the
# input, which might be completely blank.
# For each pixel, we store what tiles match in the area surrounding it, and
# the values that the pixel would have if each of those tiles was actually at
# that location.
# The result is a weighted probability distribution over the possible
# pixel values for that location. We then choose to fill the
# *most constrained* pixel (the one with the lowest entropy) by choosing a value from its probability
# distribution. Repeating this process eventually produces a value
# for every pixel (or perhaps leaving a few pixels with no matching tiles)

#INPUTS:
# Input image I (n+1-dimensional np array: n of k objects)
# Tile size t (n-tuple - nonzero)
# Initial output image O (n+1-array: n of k objects)

#WHILE COMPUTING:
# Matches M (n+1-array of size O: k * (counter, total))
# Subs S (n+1-array of size O: k * set(tiles that work))
# Tiles T (list of n+1-arrays of size t * k)
